**Josh Tynjala** is a software developer specializing in frontend GUI components, a prolific open source contributor, and loves karaoke, pinball, and the Muppets.

Since 2012, Josh has developed [Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/), a [Kickstarter-funded](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feathersui/feathers-ui-cross-platform-components-for-haxe-and-openfl) cross-platform UI component framework for creative projects ‚Äî written in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/). You can contribute a monthly donation to [Josh's work on Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/joshtynjala).

In 2022, Josh was invited to join the leadership team of [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/), in recognition of his contributions to the project. OpenFL is an implementation of the APIs in Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR, using the [Haxe programming language](https://haxe.org/). OpenFL projects can target the web with JavaScript and WebGL/Canvas; native C++ on iOS and Android mobile devices; and native C++ on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop computers (or with VMs such as Adobe AIR, Electron, and HashLink).

Josh also maintains the [ActionScript & MXML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bowlerhatllc.vscode-nextgenas) and [SWF Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bowlerhatllc.vscode-swf-debug) extensions for Visual Studio Code. Developers who are targeting [Adobe AIR](https://airsdk.dev/) or [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) should check them out!

Finally, Josh has recently started working to preserve an archive of Adobe's official Flash, AIR, and Flex documentation in Markdown format. This is possible thanks to the fact that Adobe released much of their docs during that era using a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license. See [Flash Documentation Markdown Archives](https://gist.github.com/joshtynjala/77aebc21ce9d206b0b82b6330d717461) for a list of available documents that have already been converted to Markdown.
